Brings a standard Price with VAT Included
=========================================

This module is interesting in the following case:
    * You use VAT With Price Included;
    * You want to create price list based on standard Price;

Without this module, the sale price (with a price list based on standard price)
will be bad, because the VAT will be not correctly computed;
